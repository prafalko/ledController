# ledController

This is a software that can be put on Arduino in order to control two different LED tapes and enable it by motion nearby.

I made this project, because I felt a need to enhance the lighting in my flat.
It is a very simple project, but I decided to share it, because at least it can present my coding style.

I am going to share here more difficult projects that I made, but I need some time to make them more 'shareable' :)
