# ledController

This is a software that can be put on Arduino in order to control two different LED tapes and enable it by motion nearby.

I made this project, because I felt a need to enhance the lighting in my flat.
It is a very simple project, but I decided to share it anyway.

Some day I'll share here more difficuilt projects I made.
